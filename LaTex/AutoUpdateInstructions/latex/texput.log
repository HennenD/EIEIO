textbf{State of Stock:} Gulf of Maine Atlantic cod (\textit{Gadus morhua}) stoc
k is overfished and overfishing is occurring (Figures \ref{SSB_plot1}-\ref{F_pl
ot1}). Spawning stock biomass (SSB) in 2011 is estimated to be 9,903 (mt) which
 is 18\% of the $SSB_{MSY}$ proxy (54743; Figure \ref{SSB_plot1}). The 2011 ful
ly selected fishing mortality was estimated to be 0.86 which is 478\% of the $F

textbf{Special Comments:} \begin{itemize}\item Since the middle 1990s the distr
ibution of cod has become increasingly concentrated in the western part of the 
Gulf, with a gradual loss of cod from the coastal and central Gulf.\item Since 
the middle 2000s the fishing fleet has become particularly concentrated in a sm
all region of the western Gulf due to a fince scale aggregation of cod in an ar
ea where their prey (sand lance) were increasingly available. This biases the f
ishery CPUE as an indicator of the abundance of the stock as a whole.\item If r
ecent weak recruitment of Gulf cod continues, productivity and rebuilding of th
e stock will be less than projected.\item The NEFSC 2011 fall and 2012 spring s
urvey abundance indices were the $4^{th}$ and lowest in their respective time s
eries. The MADMF 2012 spring survey index was also the lowest in its time serie
s. As the 2012 observations were not incorporated into the assessment, the proj
ections are likely to be optomistic.\end{itemize}}\def\Refr{$backslash4103backs
