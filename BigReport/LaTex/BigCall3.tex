This assessment updates commercial and recreational fishery catch data, research survey indices of abundance, the ASAP analytical models, and biological reference points through 2014. Additionally, stock projections have been updated through 2018. In what follows, there are two population assessment models brought forward from the 2014 operational assessment, the base model \(dome\-shaped survey selectivity\)  , which is used to provide management advice, and the flat sel sensitivity model \(flat\-topped survey selectivity\), which is included for the sole purpose of demonstrating the sensitivity of assessment results to survey selectivity assumptions. The most recent benchmark assessment of the pollock stock was in 2010 as part of the 50$^{th}$ Stock Assessment Review Committee \(SARC 50\; NEFSC 2010\), which includes a full description of the model formulations.} \def\POKUNITSoS{ \textbf{State of Stock: }{} The pollock \(\textit{Pollachius virens}\)  stock is not overfished and overfishing is not occurring \(Figures \ref{POKUNITSSB\_plot1}\-\ref{POKUNITF\_plot1}\){}.

Retrospective adjusted spawning stock biomass \(SSB\)  in 2014 was estimated to be 154,919 \(mt\)  under the base model and 32,040 \(mt\)  under the flat sel sensitivity model which is 147 and 58\% \(respectively\)  of the biomass target, an  \$SSB\_{MSY}\${} proxy of SSB at  \$F\_{40\%}\${} \(105,226 and 54,900  \(mt\)\;  Figure \ref{POKUNITSSB\_plot1}{}\).

Stock status is insensitive to the shape of the survey selectivity patterns at older ages.}  \item{} Does this assessment model have a retrospective pattern? If so, is the pattern minor, or major? \(A major retrospective pattern occurs when the adjusted SSB or  \$F\_{AVG}\${} lies outside of the approximate  joint confidence region for SSB and  \$F\_{AVG}\${}\; see  Figure \ref{RhoDecision\_tab}{}\). \linebreak{} \hspace\*{0.5cm} \textit{ The 7\-year Mohn\'s  \textrho{}, relative to SSB, was 0.291 under the base model and 0.66 under the flat sel sensitivity model in the 2014 assessment and was 0.284 and 0.789, respectively, in 2014. The 7\-year Mohn\'s  \textrho{}, relative to F, was \-0.252 under the base model and \-0.359 under the flat sel sensitivity model in the 2014 assessment and was \-0.276 and \-0.43, respectively, in 2014. There was a major retrospective pattern for the base model because the  \textrho{} adjusted estimate of 2014 F \(\$F\_{\rho}\${}=0.07\)  was outside the approximate 90\% confidence regions around F \(0.035 \- 0.066\).

Other sources of uncertainty were identified in previous Atlantic wolffish assessments \(NDPSWG 2009, NEFSC 2012\): the surveys may have reached the limit of wolffish detectability due to the decline in abundance\; and the lack of commercial length information results in model estimation difficulties for fishery selectivity.}  \item{} Does this assessment model have a retrospective pattern?
