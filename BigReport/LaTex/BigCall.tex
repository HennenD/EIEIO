Explain, and describe qualitatively how they affect the assessment results \(such as estimates of biomass, F, recruitment, and population projections\).  \linebreak{} \hspace\*{0.5cm} \textit{The assessment model used for Atlantic halibut is highly uncertain.  It estimates one parameter, the initial biomass, and  proceeds deterministically from 1800 to 2014.  The model is highly sensitive to the initial biomass.  The model is  tuned to the survey index, which is inefficient for Atlantic halibut, catches very few animals and is therefore noisy.   The RYM model assumes no immigration or emmigration and that the population both began, and tends to, equilibrium.   These assumptions are unlikely to be true for Atlantic halibut. The model estimates a biomass that is approximately equal  to unfished biomass, which is not credible. Catch has been very low for at least 100 years relative  to the landings reported early in the time series, despite a strong market and high value  relative to other groundfish.  The low catch throughout the century implies that the Atlantic halibut stock is very likely  depleted relative to it\'s unfished condition and is therefore likely to be overfished, even if its current biomass is  unknown.}  \item{} Does this assessment model have a retrospective pattern? If so, is the pattern minor, or major? \(A major retrospective pattern occurs when the adjusted SSB or  \$F\_{Full}\${} lies outside of the approximate  joint confidence region for SSB and  \$F\_{Full}\${}\; see  Figure \ref{RhoDecision\_tab}{}\). \linebreak{} \hspace\*{0.5cm} \textit{ The model used to determine the status of this stock does not allow estimation of a retrospective pattern. }  \item{}Based on this stock assessment, are population projections well determined or uncertain? \linebreak{} \hspace\*{0.5cm} \textit{Population projections for Atlantic halibut are uncertain because biomass cannot be reasonably determined using  the current assessment model.}  \item{}Describe any changes that were made to the current stock assessment, beyond incorporating additional years of data  and the affect these changes had on the assessment and stock status. \linebreak{} \hspace\*{0.5cm} \textit{ The catch data were slightly altered due to the exclusion of catch made in international waters and the  re\-estiamtion of average discard ratio after 1998 \(due to the incorporation of more years of data\).}  \item{}If the stock status has changed a lot since the previous assessment, explain why this occurred.  \linebreak{} \hspace\*{0.5cm} \textit{The overfishing and overfished status of Atlantic halibut cannot be determined using the current assessment.

Catches have been far below historical landings  for more than 100 years, despite a lack of regulation before 1999 and a strong commercial market.

This assessment updates commercial and recreational fishery catch data, research survey indices of abundance, and the analytical ASAPassessment models through 2014. Additionally, stock projections have been updated through 2018. In what follows, there are two population assessment models brought forward from the most recent benchmark assessment \(2012\), the M=0.2 \(natural mortality = 0.2\)  and the M\-ramp \(M ramps from 0.2 to 0.4\)  assessment models \(see NEFSC 2013 for a full description of the model formulations\).} \def\CODGMSoS{ \textbf{State of Stock: }{}Based on this updated assessment, the Gulf of Maine Atlantic cod \(\textit{Gadus morhua}\)  stock is overfished and overfishing is occurring \(Figures \ref{CODGMSSB\_plot1}\-\ref{CODGMF\_plot1}\){}. Retrospective adjustments were not made to the model results \(see Special Comments section of this report\). Spawning stock biomass \(SSB\)  in 2014 was estimated to be 2,225 \(mt\)  under the M=0.2 model and 2,536 \(mt\)  under the M\-ramp model scenario \(Table \ref{CODGMCatch\_Status\_Table}{}\)  which is 6 and 4\\percent \(respectively\)  of the biomass target,  \$SSB\_{MSY}\${} \textit{proxy}{} \(40,187 \(mt\)  and 59,045 \(mt\)\;  Figure \ref{CODGMSSB\_plot1}{}\).

The projection recruitment model declines linearly to zero when SSB is below 6.3 kmt under the M=0.2 model and 7.9 kmt under the M\-ramp model. The 2015 age\-1 recruitment was estimated from the geometric mean of the 2010\-2014 ASAP recruitment estimates. No retrospective adjustments were applied in the projections as the retrospective patterns are similar to the 2014 update for which no retrospective adjustments were made\; however, the 2015 assessment review panel recommended that that M=0.2 projections with retrospective adjustments be brought forward to the SSC for consideration in the evaluation of uncertainty when setting catch advice \(provided in the Supplemental Information Report, \href{http:\/\/www.nefsc.noaa.gov\/saw\/sasi\/sasi\_report\_options.php}{SASINF}{}\). Assumed weights are based on an average of the most recent three years.

Explain, and describe qualitatively how they affect the assessment results \(such as estimates of biomass, F, recruitment, and population projections\).  \linebreak{} \hspace\*{0.5cm} \textit{The largest source of uncertainty is the estimate of natural mortality. Past investigations into changes in natural mortality over time have been inconclusive \(NEFSC 2013\). Different assumptions about natural mortality affect the scale of the biomass, recruitment, and fishing mortality estimates. Other areas of uncertainty include the retrospective error in the M=0.2 model, residual patterns in the model fits to some of the survey series \(e.g., aggregate MADMF spring survey\)  and stock structure.}  \item{}Does this assessment model have a retrospective pattern? If so, is the pattern minor, or major? \(A major retrospective pattern occurs when the adjusted SSB or  \$F\_{Full}\${} lie outside of the approximate joint confidence region for SSB and  \$F\_{Full}\${}\). \linebreak{} \hspace\*{0.5cm} \textit{The M=0.2 model has a major retrospective pattern \(7\-year Mohn\'s rho SSB=0.54, F=\-0.31\)  and the M\-ramp model has a minor retrospective pattern \(7\-year Mohn\'s rho SSB=0.20, F=\-0.08\). The 7\-year Mohn\'s rho values from the current assessment are similar to those from the 2014 assessment \(M=0.2: SSB=0.53, F=\-0.33\; M\-ramp: SSB=0.17, F=\-0.05\)  where the M=0.2 model had a major retrospective pattern and the M\-ramp model had a minor pattern. No retrospective adjustment have been to the terminal model results or in the base catch projections following the recommendations of the SARC 55 and 2014 assessment review panels. The 2015 assessment review panel supported this decision noting that the most recent retrospective \'peel\' suggested that an adjustment using the 7\-year average may not be appropriate. However, the 2015 review panel highlighted the retrospective error in the M=0.2 model as a source of uncertainty \- it should be noted that the retrospective error of the most recent peel is larger for the M\-ramp model.

Retrospective adjustments were made to the model results.  Spawning stock biomass \(SSB\)  in 2014 was estimated to be 150,053 \(mt\)  which is 139\\percent of the biomass target \(\$SSB\_{MSY}\${} \textit{proxy}{} = 108,300\;  Figure \ref{HADGBSSB\_plot1}{}\).

The annual fishery selectivity, maturity ogive, and mean weights at age used in this projection  are the most recent 5 year averages\;  retrospective adjustments were applied to the starting numbers at age \(2015\)  in the projections.} \def\HADGBSpecCmt{ \textbf{Special Comments: } \begin{itemize}{} \item{}What are the most important sources of uncertainty in this stock assessment?  Explain, and describe qualitatively how they affect the assessment results \(such as estimates of biomass, F, recruitment, and population projections\).  \linebreak{} \hspace\*{0.5cm} \textit{The largest source of uncertainty is the estimate of 2013 recruitment, which accounts for a substantial portion of catch and SSB in projections.  The rho adjusted projections reduce all starting   numbers at age to 67\\percent of unadjusted values \(i.e., all 2015 numbers at age are multiplied by 0.667\).  Two other exceptionally large year classes were observed in 2003 and 2010.  The 2003 year class is now estimated to be only 28\\percent of its initial model estimate, while the 2010 year class is now estimated to be 63\\percent of it\'s initial estimate.  Given that only 5 years of data are available to estimate the 2010 year class, it is possible that there may be further revisions to the magnitude of this year class estimate with more years of data.  Therefore, it remains uncertain if the scalar applied to all age classes in these projections \(0.667, based on Mohn\'s rho for SSB\)  is sufficient to account for future revisions to the 2013 year class estimate.  In addition, the median recruitment in the projections \(the proxy for recruitment at MSY\)  is 53.4 million, which is greater than 7 of the last 10 recruitments even though SSB is above the SSBMSY proxy \(Table 1\). While projections of catch and SSB in the near\-term are mostly driven by the 2013 year class, it is worth noting the magnitude of median projected recruitment relative to recent recruitment observations.}  \item{} Does this assessment model have a retrospective pattern? If so, is the pattern minor, or major? \(A major retrospective pattern occurs when the adjusted SSB or  \$F\_{Full}\${} lies outside of the approximate  joint confidence region for SSB and  \$F\_{Full}\${}\). \linebreak{} \hspace\*{0.5cm} \textit{ The 7\-year Mohn\'s  \textrho{}, relative to SSB, was 0.20 in the 2012 assessment and was 0.50 in 2014. The 7\-year Mohn\'s  \textrho{}, relative to F, was \-0.15 in the 2012 assessment and was \-0.34 in 2014. There was a major retrospective pattern for this assessment because the  \textrho{} adjusted estimates of 2014 SSB \(\$SSB\_{\rho}\${}=150,053\)  and 2014 F \(\$F\_{\rho}\${}=0.241\)  were outside the approximate 90\\percent confidence regions around SSB \(171,911 \- 301,282\)  and F \(0.13 \- 0.203\).  A retrospective  adjustment was made for both the determination of stock status and for projections of catch in 2016. The retrospective adjustment changed the 2014 SSB from 225,080 to 150,053 and the 2014  \$F\_{Full}\${} from 0.159 to 0.241.}  \item{}Based on this stock assessment, are population projections well determined or uncertain? \linebreak{} \hspace\*{0.5cm} \textit{As noted in \(1\)  above, population projections for Georges Bank haddock are uncertain due to uncertainty about the size of  the 2013 year class.  Two sensitivity projections were conducted.  The first sensitivity used biological parameters and fishery selectivity values from the 2010 year class for the 2013 year class.  A second sensitivity projection was made that used the same  biological and selectivity parameters as the first sensitivity, and in addition it  doubled the rho\-adjustment on the 2013 year class \(age 2 at the start of 2015\)  by multiplying it by 0.33.  These sensitivity runs are available on the Stock Assessment Supplementary Information  website \(\href{http:\/\/www.nefsc.noaa.gov\/saw\/sasi\/sasi\_report\_options.php}{SASINF}{}\), in the sensitivity slides appended to the end of the background presentation.}  \item{}Describe any changes that were made to the current stock assessment, beyond incorporating additional years of data  and the affect these changes had on the assessment and stock status. \linebreak{} \hspace\*{0.5cm} \textit{ No changes, other than the incorporation of new data were made to the Georges Bank haddock assessment for this update. However, the criterion for determining acceptable tows on NEFSC surveys used the TOGA protocol rather than the SHG protocol  \(TOGA=132x\).}  \item{}If the stock status has changed a lot since the previous assessment, explain why this occurred.  \linebreak{} \hspace\*{0.5cm} \textit{The stock status of Georges Bank haddock has not changed.}  \item{}Indicate what data or studies are currently lacking and which would be needed most to improve this stock assessment in the future.  \linebreak{} \hspace\*{0.5cm} \textit{Projection advice and reference points for  Georges Bank haddock are strongly dependent on recruitment.  A decade ago, extremely large year classes were considered anomalies \(e.g., 1963 and 2003\).   However, since 2003, there have been two more extremely large \(2010 and 2013\)  and one very large \(2012\)  year classes.  Future work could focus on recruitment forecasting and providing robust catch advice.}  \item{}Are there other important issues? \linebreak{} \hspace\*{0.5cm} \textit{The Georges Bank haddock assessment has recently developed a major retrospective pattern.  This stock assessment has historically performed  very consistently.  This should continue to be monitored.  Density\-dependent responses in growth should also continue to be monitored.  The switch from SHG to TOGA was ruled out as the cause of the retrospective pattern.} \end{itemize}{}} \def\HADGBRefr{ \textbf{References: }{} \linebreak{}Brooks, E.N, M.L. Traver, S.J.

If so, is the pattern minor, or major? \(A major retrospective pattern occurs when the adjusted SSB or  \$F\_{Full}\${} lies outside of the approximate  joint confidence region for SSB and  \$F\_{Full}\${}\; see RhoDecisionTab.ref\). \linebreak{} \hspace\*{0.5cm} \textit{ The 7\-year Mohn\'s  \textrho{}, relative to SSB, was 0.14 in the 2012 assessment and was 1.06 in 2014. The 7\-year Mohn\'s  \textrho{}, relative to F, was \-0.16 in the 2012 assessment and was \-0.53 in 2014. There was a major retrospective pattern for this assessment because the  \textrho{} adjusted estimates of 2014 SSB \(\$SSB\_{\rho}\${}=502\)  and 2014 F \(\$F\_{\rho}\${}=1.64\)  were outside the approximate 90\\percent confidence regions around SSB \(355 \- 739\)  and F \(1.053 \- 2.348\).  However, a retrospective adjustment was not made for both the determination of stock status and for projections of catch because of the large proportion of unfeasible projections \(assumed 2015 catch required a fishing mortality rate greater than 5\). This implies the retrospective adjustment was too large or the assumed 2015 catch was too high. The review panel decided to use the unadjusted projections as an upper bound for OFL with the strong suggestion that the OFL estimates were too high \(meaning the ABC buffer should be larger than normal\).}  \item{}Based on this stock assessment, are population projections well determined or uncertain? \linebreak{} \hspace\*{0.5cm} \textit{Population projections are uncertain with projected biomass from the last assessment above the confidence bounds of the biomass estimate in the current assessment.  Further, the short\-term projections which accounted for retropective adjustment in the starting numbers\-at\-age were unrelaible due to the low percentage of feasible solutions \(33\\percent\)  encountered durring the simulation. The feasibility problem in the projections were due to the assumed 2015 projected cacth exceeding the population biomass in several of the iteration caused by the retrospective adjustment. Evaluation of the the estimated January\-1 2015 biomass from the few feasbile projections indicated that the assumed 2015 catch was approximately 98\\percent of the stock biomass.  This suggests that the assumed 2015 catch is not sustainable given the low starting abundance in the forecast. Alternatively, the retro unadjusted projections performed well, but it is likely to result in an overly optimistic projection of the fishery yield and population biomass.}  \item{}Describe any changes that were made to the current stock assessment, beyond incorporating additional years of data  and the affect these changes had on the assessment and stock status. \linebreak{} \hspace\*{0.5cm} \textit{ There were no major changes to the current stock assessment formulation. However, the criterion for determining acceptable tows on the NEFSC surveys were revised for years the Bigelow year \(i.e. 2009\-2011\)  and carried foreward to ensure consistency between the assessment and deck operations.  The influence of the revised protocol on the survey indices was inconsequential.}  \item{}If the stock status has changed a lot since the previous assessment, explain why this occurred.  \linebreak{} \hspace\*{0.5cm} \textit{The overfishing and biomass stock status have changed since the previous assessment due to increased catches relative to the stock biomass and the very low recruitment of young fish, contributing very little to the adult biomass.}  \item{}Indicate what data or studies are currently lacking and which would be needed most to improve this stock assessment in the future.  \linebreak{} \hspace\*{0.5cm} \textit{The emergence of retrospective bias in this assessment is not clearly understood and may result from a variety of sources.  Future studiesshould further investigate the source of this retrospective pattern to help improve the underlying diagnostics of the model for providing catch advice for this stock.  Recruitment for Southern New England\-Mid Atlantic yellowtail flounder continues to be weak and it is likely that the stock is in a new productivity regime.  Should this pattern of poor recruitment continue into the future, the ability of the stock to recover will be impeded. Therefore, future studies should build on current knowledge to further understand the underlying ecological mechanisms of poor recruitment in the stock as it may relate to the physical environment.}  \item{}Are there other important issues? \linebreak{} \hspace\*{0.5cm} \textit{None. } \end{itemize}{}} \def\YELSNEMARefr{ \textbf{References: }{}  \linebreak{} Alade, L,  C.

Retrospective adjustments were made to the model results.  Spawning stock biomass \(SSB\)  in 2014 was estimated to be 2,883 \(mt\)  which is 43\\percent of the biomass target for an overfished stock \(\$SSB\_{MSY}\${} = 6,700 with a threshold of 50\\percent of SSBMSY\;  Figure \ref{FLWGBSSB\_plot1}{}\).

However, the 2014 point estimate of SSB and F, when adjusted for retrospective error \(83\\percent for SSB and \-51\\percent for F\), is outside the 90\\percent confidence interval of the unadjusted 2014 point estimate. Therefore, the 2014 F and SSB values used in the stock status determination were the retrospective\-adjusted values of 0.778 and 2,883 mt, respectively.} \def\FLWGBProj{ \textbf{Projections: }{}Short\-term projections of biomass were derived by sampling from a cumulative  distribution  function of recruitment estimates \(1982\-2013 YC\)  from the final run of the ADAPT VPA model. The annual fishery selectivity, maturity ogive, and mean weights\-at\-age used in the projection  are the most recent 5 year averages \(2010\-2014\). An SSB retrospective adjustment factor of 0.546 was applied in the projections.} \def\FLWGBSpecCmt{ \textbf{Special Comments: } \begin{itemize}{} \item{}What are the most important sources of uncertainty in this stock assessment?  Explain, and describe qualitatively how they affect the assessment results \(such as estimates of biomass, F, recruitment, and population projections\).  \linebreak{} \hspace\*{0.5cm} \textit{The largest source of uncertainty is the estimate of natural mortality based on longevity \(max. age = 20 for this stock\), which is not well studied in Georges Bank Winter Flounder, and assumed constant over time.  Natural mortality affects the scale of the biomass and fishing mortality estimates. Other sources of uncertainty include the underestimation of catches. Discards from the Canadian bottom trawl fleet were not provided by the CA DFO and the precision of the Canadian scallop dredge discard estimates, with only 1\-2 trips per month, are uncertain.The lack of age data for the Canadian spring survey catches requires the use of the US spring survey A\/L keys despite selectivity differences. In addition, there are no length or age composition data from the Canadian landings or discards GB winter flounder.}  \item{} Does this assessment model have a retrospective pattern? If so, is the pattern minor, or major? \(A major retrospective pattern occurs when the adjusted SSB or  \$F\_{Full}\${} lies outside of the approximate  joint confidence region for SSB and  \$F\_{Full}\${}\; see  Figure \ref{RhoDecision\_tab}{}\). \linebreak{} \hspace\*{0.5cm} \textit{ The 7\-year Mohn\'s  \textrho{}, relative to SSB, was 0.26 in the 2014 assessment and was 0.83 in 2014. The 7\-year Mohn\'s  \textrho{}, relative to F, was \-0.16 in the 2014 assessment and was \-0.51 in 2014. There was a major retrospective pattern for this assessment because the  \textrho{} adjusted estimates of 2014 SSB \(\$SSB\_{\rho}\${}=2,883\)  and 2014 F \(\$F\_{\rho}\${}=0.778\)  were outside the approximate 90\\percent confidence region around SSB \(3,783 \- 6,767\)  and F \(0.254 \- 0.504\).  A retrospective  adjustment was made for both the determination of stock status and for projections of catch in 2016. The retrospective adjustment changed the 2014 SSB from 5,275 to 2,883 and the 2014  \$F\_{Full}\${} from 0.379 to 0.778.}  \item{}Based on this stock assessment, are population projections well determined or uncertain? \linebreak{} \hspace\*{0.5cm} \textit{Population projections for Georges Bank Winter Flounder are reasonably well determined.}  \item{}Describe any changes that were made to the current stock assessment, beyond incorporating additional years of data  and the affect these changes had on the assessment and stock status. \linebreak{} \hspace\*{0.5cm} \textit{ The only change made to the Georges Bank Winter Flounder assessment, other than the incorporation of an additional  year of data, involved fishery selectivity.  During the 2014 assessment update, stock size estimates of age 1 and age 2 fish were not estimable  in the VPA during year t + 1 \(CVs near 1.0\). When age 2 stock size is not estimated in year t + 1,  the VPA model calculates the stock size of age 1 fish \(i.e., recruitment\)  in the terminal year by  using the age 1 partial recruitment \(PR\)  value to derive the F at age 1 in the terminal year. The  age 1 PR value used in the 2014 assessment update was 0.001. However, when this same age 1 PR value  was used in a VPA run for the current assessment update, the low PR value combined with the low age  1 catch in 2014 resulted in an unlikely high stock size estimate for age 1 recruitment in 2014 \(i.e.,  41,587,000 fish\)  when compared to survey observations of the same cohort \(i.e., age 1 in 2014 and age  2 in 2015\). In order to obtain a more realistic estimate of age 1 recruitment in 2014, I allowed the  VPA model to estimate age 2 stock size in 2015 \(i.e., and thereby avoided the use of an age 1 PR  value in the age 1 stock size calculation for 2014\)  and used the back\-calculated PR values from this  VPA run to derive a new PR\-at\-age vector which was used in the final 2015 VPA run. Similar to the  2014 assessment update, the final 2015 VPA run did not include the estimation of age 2 stock size  and the new PR\-at\-age vector was computed using the same methods as in the 2014 assessment.   Full selectivity occurs at age 4. For the 2015 assessment update, fishery selectivity for ages  1\-3 was changed from the 2014 assessment values of 0.001, 0.10 and 0.43, respectively, to 0.01,  0.08 and 0.55, respectively. Differences between estimates  of F, SSB and R values from the final  2015 VPA run, with the new PR vector, and a 2015 VPA run that utilized the PR vector from the 2014  assessment are shown in Table G30.}  \item{}If the stock status has changed a lot since the previous assessment, explain why this occurred.  \linebreak{} \hspace\*{0.5cm} \textit{The overfished and overfishing status of Georges Bank Winter Flounder has changed in the current assessment update due to a worsening of the retrospective error associated with fishing mortality and SSB.}  \item{}Indicate what data or studies are currently lacking and which would be needed most to improve this stock assessment in the future.  \linebreak{} \hspace\*{0.5cm} \textit{The Georges Bank Winter Flounder assessment could be improved with discard estimates from the Canadian bottom trawl fleet and age data from the Canadian spring bottom trawl surveys.}  \item{}Are there other important issues? \linebreak{} \hspace\*{0.5cm} \textit{None. } \end{itemize}{}} \def\FLWGBRefr{ \textbf{References: }{} \linebreak{} Hendrickson L, Nitschke P, Linton B. 2015. 2014 Operational Stock Assessments for Georges Bank winter flounder, Gulf of Maine winter flounder, and pollock.

Since the commercial catch is aged primarily with survey age\/length keys, there is considerable augmentation required, mainly for ages 5 and older. The numbers at age and mean weights at age in the catch for these ages may therefore not be well specified.  \linebreak{} \hspace\*{0.5cm}3.

This assessment updates commercial and recreational fishery catch data, research survey indices of abundance, the ASAP analytical models, and biological reference points through 2014. Additionally, stock projections have been updated through 2018. In what follows, there are two population assessment models brought forward from the 2014 operational assessment, the base model \(dome\-shaped survey selectivity\)  , which is used to provide management advice, and the flat sel sensitivity model \(flat\-topped survey selectivity\), which is included for the sole purpose of demonstrating the sensitivity of assessment results to survey selectivity assumptions. The most recent benchmark assessment of the pollock stock was in 2010 as part of the 50$^{th}$ Stock Assessment Review Committee \(SARC 50\; NEFSC 2010\), which includes a full description of the model formulations.} \def\POKUNITSoS{ \textbf{State of Stock: }{} The pollock \(\textit{Pollachius virens}\)  stock is not overfished and overfishing is not occurring \(Figures \ref{POKUNITSSB\_plot1}\-\ref{POKUNITF\_plot1}\){}. Retrospective adjustments were made to the model results. Retrospective adjusted spawning stock biomass \(SSB\)  in 2014 was estimated to be 154,919 \(mt\)  under the base model and 32,040 \(mt\)  under the flat sel sensitivity model which is 147 and 58\\percent \(respectively\)  of the biomass target, an  \$SSB\_{MSY}\${} proxy of SSB at  \$F\_{40\\percent}\${} \(105,226 and 54,900  \(mt\)\;  Figure \ref{POKUNITSSB\_plot1}{}\).

Catch in 2015 has been estimated at 5,208 \(mt\). Recruitments were sampled from a cumulative distribution function derived from ASAP estimated age 1 recruitment between 1970 and 2012.  Recruitments in 2013 and 2014 were not included due to uncertainty in those estimates. The annual fishery selectivity, natural mortality, maturity ogive, and mean weights used  in projections are the most recent 5 year averages.

Stock status is insensitive to the shape of the survey selectivity patterns at older ages.}  \item{} Does this assessment model have a retrospective pattern? If so, is the pattern minor, or major? \(A major retrospective pattern occurs when the adjusted SSB or  \$F\_{AVG}\${} lies outside of the approximate  joint confidence region for SSB and  \$F\_{AVG}\${}\; see  Figure \ref{RhoDecision\_tab}{}\). \linebreak{} \hspace\*{0.5cm} \textit{ The 7\-year Mohn\'s  \textrho{}, relative to SSB, was 0.291 under the base model and 0.66 under the flat sel sensitivity model in the 2014 assessment and was 0.284 and 0.789, respectively, in 2014. The 7\-year Mohn\'s  \textrho{}, relative to F, was \-0.252 under the base model and \-0.359 under the flat sel sensitivity model in the 2014 assessment and was \-0.276 and \-0.43, respectively, in 2014. There was a major retrospective pattern for the base model because the  \textrho{} adjusted estimate of 2014 F \(\$F\_{\rho}\${}=0.07\)  was outside the approximate 90\\percent confidence regions around F \(0.035 \- 0.066\).

Stock status based on the flat sel sensitivity model has changed from \'overfishing is occurring\' in the previous assessment to \'overfishing is not occurring\' in the current assessment. Though, the retrospective adjusted 2014 age 5 to 7 average fishing mortality  from the flat sel sensitivity model \(0.233\)  is close to the  \$F\_{MSY}\${} proxy \(0.252\). This change in status likely is due to a decline in predicted F from 2013 to 2014, as well as to the exclusion of the likelihood constants, which led to higher predicted stock productivity.}  \item{}Indicate what data or studies are currently lacking and which would be needed most to improve this stock assessment in the future.  \linebreak{} \hspace\*{0.5cm} \textit{The pollock assessment could be improved with additional studies on gear selectivity. These studies could cover topics such as physical selectivity \(e.g., multi\-mesh gillnet\), behavior \(e.g., swimming endurance, escape behavior\), geographic and vertical distribution by size and age, tag\-recovery at size and age, and evaluating information on length\-specific selectivity at older ages.}  \item{}Are there other important issues? \linebreak{} \hspace\*{0.5cm} \textit{As in the previous assessment, the pollock assessment models had difficulty converging on a solution in some of the retrospective peels. One possible explanation for this convergence issue is that the model may be overparameterized, because the commercial and recreational fleets are modeled separately in this assessment. The possibility of combining the two fleets into a single fleet should be explored during the next benchmark assessment.} \end{itemize}{}} \def\POKUNITRefr{ \textbf{References: }{} \linebreak{}Hendrickson L, Nitschke P, Linton B. 2015. 2014 Operational stock assessments for Georges Bank winter flounder, Gulf of Maine winter flounder, and pollock.

Other sources of uncertainty were identified in previous Atlantic wolffish assessments \(NDPSWG 2009, NEFSC 2012\): the surveys may have reached the limit of wolffish detectability due to the decline in abundance\; and the lack of commercial length information results in model estimation difficulties for fishery selectivity.}  \item{} Does this assessment model have a retrospective pattern?

Continued histological sampling over the next several years should allow for the development of a definitive maturity ogive that can be used in the next assessment.}  \item{}Are there other important issues? \linebreak{} \hspace\*{0.5cm} \textit{Recruitment at the end of the time series increases toward the initial recruitment estimate \(Table 1\; Figure 3\)  because there is no information in the model to inform these estimates. There is no indication in the data that recruitment has increased recently.  \linebreak{} \hspace\*{0.5cm}Approximate 90\\percent lognormal confidence intervals are not shown in Figures 1\-3 because MCMC is not fully developed for the SCALE model.} \end{itemize}{}} \def\CATUNITRefr{ \textbf{References: }{} \linebreak{} \linebreak{}Grant SM, Hiscock W. 2014.
