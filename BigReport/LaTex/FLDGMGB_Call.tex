Based on the 2012 assessment the stock was overfished, and overfishing was occurring.

Retrospective adjustments were not made to the model results. The mean NEFSC fall bottom trawl survey index from years 2012, 2013 and 2014 (a 3-year moving average is used as a biomass index)  was 0.535 kg/tow which is lower than the $B_{Threshold}${} of 0.777 kg/tow. The 2014 relative fishing mortality was estimated to be 0.393 kt per kg/tow, which is lower than the  $F_{MSY}${} \textit{proxy}{} of 0.450 kt per kg/tow.} \def\FLDGMGBProj{} \def\FLDGMGBSpecCmt{ \textbf{Special Comments: } \begin{itemize}{} \item{}What are the most important sources of uncertainty in this stock assessment?  Explain, and describe qualitatively how they affect the assessment results (such as estimates of biomass, F, recruitment, and population projections).  \linebreak{} \hspace*{0.5cm} \textit{The main source of uncertainty in this assessment is the lack of windowpane discard estimates from Canadian fisheries to add to the catch component of model input. Discard estimates were from the US only. There is overlap between the survey area and Canadian fishing grounds (Van Eeckhaute et al. 2010), which means catch from within the stock area was likely underestimated. }  \item{} Does this assessment model have a retrospective pattern? If so, is the pattern minor, or major? (A major retrospective pattern occurs when the adjusted SSB or  $F_{Full}${} lies outside of the approximate  joint confidence region for SSB and  $F_{Full}${}; see  Table \ref{RhoDecision_tab}{}). \linebreak{} \hspace*{0.5cm} \textit{ The model used to estimate status of this stock does not allow estimation of a retrospective pattern. }  \item{}Based on this stock assessment, are population projections well determined or uncertain? \linebreak{} \hspace*{0.5cm} \textit{N/A }  \item{}Describe any changes that were made to the current stock assessment, beyond incorporating additional years of data  and the effect these changes had on the assessment and stock status. \linebreak{} \hspace*{0.5cm} \textit{No changes were made to the northern windowpane flounder assessment for this update  other than the incorporation of four years of new NEFSC fall bottom trawl survey data and  four years of new US commercial landings and discard data (2011 - 2014). }  \item{}If the stock status has changed a lot since the previous assessment, explain why this occurred.  \linebreak{} \hspace*{0.5cm} \textit{The stock status of northern windowpane flounder changed from 'overfished and overfishing is occurring' to 'overfished and overfishing is not occurring' due to stable-to-decreasing catch since 2008, and an increasing trend in the survey index since 2010. }  \item{}Indicate what data or studies are currently lacking and which would be needed most to improve this stock assessment in the future.  \linebreak{} \hspace*{0.5cm} \textit{The northern windowpane flounder assessment could be improved by estimating the Canadian windowpane removals and to a lesser degree, the 'general category' scallop dredge fleet discards from within the stock area and using them as additional catch input to the AIM model.  While the model fit now is reasonable (the relationship between ln(relative F)  and ln(replacement ratio), a measure of the relationship between catch and survey index values, has a p-value of 0.079)  there are probably removals unaccounted for in the model and the fit can likely be improved. }  \item{}Are there other important issues? \linebreak{} \hspace*{0.5cm} \textit{None. } \end{itemize}{}} \def\FLDGMGBRefr{ \textbf{References: }{} \linebreak{} \linebreak{} Northeast Fisheries Science Center. 2012.
