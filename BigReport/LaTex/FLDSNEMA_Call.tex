Retrospective adjustments were not made to the model results. The mean NEFSC fall bottom trawl survey index from years 2012, 2013, and 2014 (a 3-year moving average is used as a biomass index)  was  0.413 (kg/tow), which is higher than the $B_{Threshold}${} of 0.123 (kg/tow).

Explain, and describe qualitatively how they affect the assessment results (such as estimates of biomass, F, recruitment, and population projections).  \linebreak{} \hspace*{0.5cm} \textit{A source of uncertainty for this assessment is missing commercial discard estimates from the general category scallop dredge fleet that should be added to the catch time series for model input. }  \item{} Does this assessment model have a retrospective pattern? If so, is the pattern minor, or major? (A major retrospective pattern occurs when the adjusted SSB or  $F_{Full}${} lies outside of the approximate  joint confidence region for SSB and  $F_{Full}${}; see  Table \ref{RhoDecision_tab}{}). \linebreak{} \hspace*{0.5cm} \textit{ The model used to estimate status of this stock does not allow estimation of a retrospective pattern. }  \item{}Based on this stock assessment, are population projections well determined or uncertain? \linebreak{} \hspace*{0.5cm} \textit{N/A}  \item{}Describe any changes that were made to the current stock assessment, beyond incorporating additional years of data  and the effect these changes had on the assessment and stock status. \linebreak{} \hspace*{0.5cm} \textit{ No changes were made to the southern windowpane flounder assessment for this update  other than the incorporation of 4 years of new NEFSC fall bottom trawl survey data and  4 years of new U.S. commercial landings and discard data (2011 - 2014). }  \item{}If the stock status has changed a lot since the previous assessment, explain why this occurred.  \linebreak{} \hspace*{0.5cm} \textit{The stock status of southern windowpane flounder has not changed since the previous assessment. }  \item{}Indicate what data or studies are currently lacking and which would be needed most to improve this stock assessment in the future.  \linebreak{} \hspace*{0.5cm} \textit{Estimates of discards from the general category scallop dredge fleet should be added to the catch time series for model input. However, the model fit is presently good with a randomization test indicating the correlation between ln(relative F)  and ln(replacement ratio), which is a measure of the relationship between catch and survey index values, is significant (p = 0.002.)  }  \item{}Are there other important issues? \linebreak{} \hspace*{0.5cm} \textit{None. } \end{itemize}{}} \def\FLDSNEMARefr{ \textbf{References: }{} \linebreak{} \linebreak{} Northeast Fisheries Science Center. 2012.
