%Executive Summary

\section{Executive Summary}
\textit{Note:Working Paper}


Update assessments were conducted for the twenty stocks in the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan in 2015 (Table \ref{stock_abbrv_tab}). The updates replicated the methods recommended in the most recent benchmark decisions, as modified by any subsequent operational assessments or updates (Table \ref{stock_info_tab}), with the intention of simply adding years of data (Table \ref{data_used_tab}). However, minor flexibility was allowed to address emerging issues (Table \ref{Assess_type_tab}).

Stock status did not change for 15 of the 20 stocks, worsened for two stocks, improved for one stock, and became more uncertain for two stocks (Table \ref{sos_tab}).

The number of stocks with retrospective adjustments applied increased from the last assessment from 2 to 7 (Table \ref{RhoAdjust_tab}). The previous Georges Bank cod assessment did apply a retrospective adjustment, however, the assessment model was not approved at the 2015 Updates so it has been excluded from these counts.

While the number of overfished stocks and stocks experiencing overfishing has generally decreased since 2007 (Figure \ref{stock_status}), the magnitude of overfishing or depletion for several stocks has worsened considerably (Figures \ref{propFmsy} and \ref{propBmsy}); Gulf of Maine cod, Southern New England/Mid-Atlantic yellowtail flounder, witch flounder and Cape Cod/Gulf of Maine yellowtail flounder). Of those Northeast groundfish stocks for which stock status can be determined, the majority remain below their biomass targets ($69\%$; Figures \ref{stock_status} and \ref{propBmsy}).

Recent NEFSC survey biomass indices for both the spring and fall surveys are below the long term means. For the majority of stocks the average of the most recent five years are below the time series means (Figures \ref{nefscSpringResiduals} and \ref{nefscFallResiduals})

Estimates of overall (aggregate) groundfish minimum swept area biomass are at, or near, all-time highs (Figures \ref{nefscSpringMinSweptAreaBiomass} and \ref{nefscFallMinSweptAreaBiomass}).  However, the current stock diversity of the overall groundfish biomass is less than that seen in the 1960s and 1970s. Current groundfish biomass is dominated by only a few stocks: For example the combined biomass of the Georges Bank haddock, Gulf of Maine haddock, and redfish stocks currently make up more than $80\%$ of the overall groundfish biomass (Figure \ref{propBiomassHaddockRedfish}). 

Information supplemental to the assessment report for each stock can found on the Stock Assessment Support Information (\href{http://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/saw/sasi/sasi_report_options.php}{SASINF}{}) website.

The appendix to this document contains: The letter from the Northeast Regional Coordinating Council providing guidance on the operational assessment procedure (Section \ref{NRCCletter}), a summary of the meeting with the Assessment Oversight Panel during which assessment plans were developed (Section \ref{AOPsum}), a summary of NEFSC outreach on 2015 groundfish operational assessments (Section \ref{OutreachSum}) and statements from fishing industry members (Section \ref{IndLetter}).

The 'Intermediate assessment' represents the last stock assessment conducted prior to the OA 2015 assessment (year varies by stock). Stocks on which overfishing is occurring are those where the $\frac{F_{terminal}}{F_{MSY proxy}}$ ratio is greater than 1 and overfished stocks are those where the $\frac{B_{terminal}}{B_{MSY{}proxy}}$ ratio is less than 0.5. \textit{Notes: (1) the GARM III assessments did not include wolfish; (2) for the intermediate assessments stock status could not be determined for Gulf of Maine winter flounder (OA 2014) or Georges Bank yellowtail (TRAC 2015); and, (3) based on the OA 2015 assessments stock status could not be determined for Atlantic halibut, Gulf of Maine winter flounder and Georges Bank yellowtail flounder. In the OA 2015 assessment, the stock status for Georges Bank cod remained overfished and overfishing is occurring; however, since the assessment was rejected, ratios of terminal conditions to reference points cannot be determined.
